# RASA Deep Dive: The Strategic Stock Analyst (SSA) Persona

---

## üìå Example Full-Stack Command

```bash
python -m clients.rasa --mode api run --persona strategic_stock_analyst   --input "Give me a detailed buy or sell recommendation for Nvidia, including current risks, valuation, sector trends, and alternative picks if I'm a cautious investor focused on technology or healthcare."   --preferences risk_tolerance=low --preferences sector=technology --preferences alt_sector=healthcare --stream
```

  - long_term_frame
operators:
  - preference_agent
  - critic_agent
  - explain_operator
  - alt_recommendation_operator
prompt_style: detailed
metadata:
  tone: analytical
  domain: finance
  preferred_sources: ["Yahoo Finance", "Seeking Alpha", "Bloomberg"]
  persona_traits: ["cautious", "comprehensive"]

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Flow: RASA SSA Persona

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Input, Preferences] --> B(Persona Loader<br>YAML)
    B --> C(Runner)
    C --> D1(Stateless Frame)
    D1 --> D2(Session Frame)
    D2 --> D3(Short Term Frame)
    D3 --> D4(Long Term Frame)
    D4 --> E1(Preference Agent)
    E1 --> E2(Critic Agent)
    E2 --> E3(Explain Operator)
    E3 --> E4(Alt Recommendation Operator)
    E4 --> F(LLM Adapter)
    F --> G(Output Stream)
    G --> H[User]
```

**Explanation:**
- Each box represents a frame (cognitive layer) or operator (reasoning tool).
- The flow moves left-to-right: input is progressively shaped and enriched before reaching the LLM.
- The output is delivered to the user, streaming if enabled.

```

**Deep Dive Explanation:**
- **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop):** User feedback or overrides can flow back into the Runner for correction, re-prompting, or validation before final output.
- **Tools Layer:** `Tool Invocation` enables access to external APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance) or databases. Tools can be called by operators as needed for richer, up-to-date information.
- **LLM Adapter:** Handles the prompt sent to the LLM provider (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.), abstracts away backend-specific logic.
- **LLM Response Loop:** Output can be reviewed by the Critic Agent, which may re-enter the LLM loop for refinement or further explanation.
- **Streaming:** Final output is delivered to the user, supporting real-time interaction.

## üß† Developer Notes

- **Persona Loader** parses the YAML and assembles the full stack (frames, operators, tools).
- **Runner** is the orchestrator, routing state and input through frames and invoking operators in order.
- **Frames** represent different memory and context layers. Each one can update or pass along "state".
- **Operators** act as reasoning steps and may call out to tools or external APIs.
- **LLM Adapter** manages prompt formatting, sending, and parsing LLM results.
- **HITL** enables robust QA, safety, or regulatory review before output‚Äîplanned as part of the RASA design direction.

---

## üö¶ Current State & Aspirational Design

**This is the final architecture we aspire to fully realize with RASA.**
- Some components (e.g., full vector memory, multi-round HITL, advanced tool orchestration) may be in-progress or partially implemented.
- The design emphasizes maximum modularity and clarity for future contributors.
